# Q1)
a. Insertion sort takes O(k^2) time per k-element list in worst case time. therefore sorting n/k such k-element lists, takesO(k^2n/k)=O(nk) worst case time
b. Merging is going to be O(n) at each level. The number of levels is n/k with k element list and creating a n element list
total running time would be O(n log(n/k))
